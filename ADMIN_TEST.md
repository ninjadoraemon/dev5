# Admin Login Test Results

## Issue Found and Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem:** Admin login was not working because the backend login endpoint was not returning the `role` field in the response.

**Root Cause:** 
- The `/api/auth/login` endpoint was only returning `id`, `email`, and `name`
- The frontend checks for `role === 'admin'` to allow admin access
- Without the role field, the check was failing

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated both `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register` endpoints
- Now both return the `role` field in the user object
- Backend restarted successfully
